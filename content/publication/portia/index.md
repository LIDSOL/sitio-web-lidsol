abstract: >
  The principal objective of neural rehabilitation therapies is helping
  affected people to recover their mobility and reduce their dependency
  to other people in personal and occupational life. The way neural
  rehabilitation therapies are applied used to be based on the experience
  of the therapists and the epidemiological data available. Meanwhile,
  computer games (serious games), specially, based on virtual reality, are
  already used to treat exclusively certain types of phobia considering that
  an effective therapy consists on exposing patients to the source of their
  pathological fear within a controlled and safe environment. At present,
  at National Autonomous University of Mexico we are developing a set of
  applications based on videogames technology, programming them by the Unity
  SDK. The idea is helping patients to recover their mobility, which was lost
  by a neurological accident, or to confront their phobia. In this work we
  present the corresponding advances. In the case of neural rehabilitation,
  we focus the applications for ocular, head and neck recovery, developing
  some 3D scenarios for the Oculus Rift device. Respect to phobia treatment
  we consider attending arachnophobia, acrophobia and aviophobia, developing
  some 3D scenarios for Card Boards and also the Oculus Rift.
